# This repo is made for tracking and presenting coding projects

## Every one of the following projects contains a more detailed README in the designated folder, with more detailed explanations regarding what the application does and how. <br />
1. Course Management System - Relatively large scale project of over 3k coding lines - The project posseses databases of various Technion courses, 
   and is designed to help manage them from two perspectives, via two applications: <br />
   a. Course Scheduling System - This application is an interactive CLI (file I\O also supported) graphing calculator, allowing users to define, save/load, display and       mathematically manipulate directed graphs representing the recommended course schedules in various faculties, or fields within faculties. <br />
   This application is designated to allow  the user analysis of the level and character of correlation between their study fields' schedules  <br />
   and those of other fields, for the purpose of comparison, destined transition, general planning or plain curiosity.  <br />
   From a programmatical point of view, this project demonstrates challenging complex parsing and algorithmic logic.  <br />
   b. Course Viewing System - This application, also a CLI, is designated to implement an interface that allows the user manage the viewing time of various recordings of courses and lectures entered. 
   <br />This project strongly emphasizes correct implementation and usage of various data structures (see project README for further informations). <br />
   All data structures are self-implemented (No STL usage, for the sake of practice).  <br />
   ##### Solo Effort <br />
   #### Programming Language : CPP  <br />
  
 2. Linux Shell Implementation - Project written in cooperation with a single partner, as part of a school project. <br />
    This project Implements a fully functioning Linux Shell. The project includes implementation of various bash commands (background and foreground), inter-process  communication (including Pipes), Partial Signal Handling, and job_list maintenance.<br />
    Should mainly demonstrate understanding a grasp of how Opearting Systems work,  specifically on Linux.  Utilizes Factory and Singleton Design approaches. <br />
    ##### Developed with a partner <br />
    #### Programming Language : CPP <br />
   
   
3. Scrabbles Game - A pygame scrabbles game implementation for two players. Demonstrating basic UI implementation and Design (via the pygame module), OOP and various algorithmic      approaches. Also, It's just plain fun!  <br />
   ##### Solo Effort <br />
   #### Programming Language : Python  <br />
   
4. Linux Multithreaded webserver Implementation - Project written in cooperation with a single partner, as part of a school project. <br />
    This project Implements a TCP/IP webserver made to receive and fulfill client requests in a prallel manner (using pthreads library). <br />
    Project also supports maintaining of various server based statistics (all described in project README).  <br />
    Showcases mainly application of thread synchronization principles.<br />
    ##### Developed with a partner <br />
    #### Programming Language : C<br />
    
5.  Implementation of malloc, calloc, realloc and free with varoius heap managing optimizations (described in project README). <br />
    Implements and uses a segregated free-list bin array data structure for free heap blocks, and a doubly-linked list for all heap allocated blocks.
    Main focus is on minimizing external fragmentation, heap memory usage, and time complexity.
    ##### Developed with a partner <br />
    #### Programming Language : CPP <br />
   
 
 3. Python Stock Scanner - Scrape stock data from online resource and parse into spreasheet. Also attached VBA code for statistical calculations.  <br />
   ##### Solo Effort <br />
   #### Programming Language : Python  <br />
